# Blockchain

#### Microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions using blockchain

> Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected.
> What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed.
> Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology.
> In this project, I will try yourself at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and exchange messages and transactions using blockchain.
> As difficult as the project might be, it is bound to pay off: not in cryptocurrency, but in knowledge and skills
> #### Learning outcomes
>> Get a profound understanding of how blockchains work,
>> apply your hashing and multithreading skills and learn about (de)serialization: many great topics in one exciting project.
